# Current Project Status
**Last Updated:** January 25, 2025

## 🎯 Current Phase: Phase 1.5 - Multi-Item Analysis & Enhanced Logging

### ✅ What's Completed
- **Phase 0**: Core app structure, camera, gallery, AI analysis, price estimation, data persistence
- **Phase 1**: Enhanced object detection pipeline with >95% precision, intelligent filtering, multi-API integration
- **Performance**: Monitoring service, quality metrics, optimization, testing framework

### ⚠️ Partially Complete
- **Backend Analysis**: ✅ Complete (Google Vision, Amazon Rekognition, enhanced detection)
- **UI Visualization**: ❌ Missing (bounding boxes, interactive selection, confidence display)
- **Multi-Item UI**: ❌ Missing (multiple items per photo, visibility indicators, alerts)

### 🚧 Currently Working On
**Enhanced Logging System** - Just completed comprehensive spec with:
- Raw API data logging (Google Vision + Amazon Rekognition)
- Color detection debugging and comparison
- Overlap analysis and visibility calculations
- External logging integration (Splunk MCP, Datadog, LogRocket)
- Cursor integration for real-time debugging

### 📋 Next Steps (Phase 1.5)
1. **Implement Enhanced Logging System** (Priority 1)
   - Create centralized logging service
   - Add raw API response capture
   - Implement overlap analysis logging
   - Set up external logging integration

2. **Per-Item Analysis Pipeline** (Priority 2)
   - Modify AI analysis to work per-item instead of photo-level
   - Implement visibility analysis (>30% overlap threshold)
   - Create multiple items UI with visibility indicators
   - Add partial visibility alerts (<50% visible items)

3. **Color Detection Debugging** (Priority 3)
   - Log color data from both APIs
   - Identify and fix color detection inconsistencies

4. **Complete UI Visualization** (Priority 4)
   - Implement bounding box visualization on photos
   - Add interactive item selection
   - Complete confidence visualization

### 🔄 Ready to Begin
- **Phase 2**: Advanced Item Management (user override system, individual editing, batch operations)

### 📊 Progress Summary
- **Phase 0**: ✅ 100% Complete
- **Phase 1**: ✅ 100% Complete  
- **Phase 1.5**: 🚧 15% Complete (spec done, implementation pending)
- **Phase 2**: ⏳ Ready to begin
- **Phase 3+**: ⏳ Future phases

### 🎯 Current Focus
**Enhanced Logging System** - This will solve the multiple items problem and color detection issues identified in the multi-item analysis discussion. The logging system will provide comprehensive debugging data to understand current data flow and identify root causes.
