# Product Mission (Lite)

Looksy is a mobile app that helps individuals, resellers, and estate planners efficiently catalog and value their items by providing AI-powered image analysis and automated price estimation.

Looksy serves tax donors, resellers, and estate planners who need accurate item valuations without expensive professional services. Unlike single-source valuation apps, Looksy combines Google Cloud Vision, Amazon Rekognition, and AI summarization to generate single comprehensive descriptions with projected higher accuracy through multi-API ensemble analysis.
