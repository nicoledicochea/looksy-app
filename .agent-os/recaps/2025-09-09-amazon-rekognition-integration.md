# 2025-09-09 Recap: Amazon Rekognition Integration

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-09-amazon-rekognition-integration/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented Amazon Rekognition integration as the first feature from the roadmap, enabling multi-API ensemble analysis for enhanced item detection accuracy. The implementation includes a complete Amazon Rekognition service with AWS SDK integration, comprehensive usage tracking system with limits and statistics, robust data storage migration from v1.0.0 to v1.1.0, parallel API execution using Promise.allSettled for simultaneous Google Vision and Amazon Rekognition calls, and updated UI components to reflect the dual AI analysis approach.

Key accomplishments:
- Created Amazon Rekognition service with proper AWS SDK integration and error handling
- Implemented usage tracking system with 1000 image limits per API and real-time statistics
- Updated data storage with migration logic and separate API result fields
- Integrated parallel API execution in PhotoContext with fallback logic for individual API failures
- Updated Settings screen to display API usage statistics
- Added comprehensive test coverage with 16 passing tests
- Updated UI to reflect dual AI analysis approach with improved loading states

## Context

Integrate Amazon Rekognition API as a secondary AI service to work alongside Google Cloud Vision for enhanced item detection accuracy. This implements the first feature from the roadmap and establishes the foundation for multi-API ensemble analysis. The integration includes AWS SDK setup, usage tracking with limits, data migration for new Photo interface fields, parallel API execution, and UI updates to reflect the dual AI approach.
