# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Object Detection Enhancement
> Created: 2025-09-21

## Overview

Enhance the existing object detection pipeline to achieve >95% precision with <3% false positive rate by improving segmentation precision, contextual filtering, and detection quality metrics. This will significantly improve the accuracy of item detection, especially for complex scenarios like detecting a wristwatch without including the wearer's sleeve.

## User Stories

### Enhanced Segmentation Precision

As a user cataloging jewelry and accessories, I want the AI to provide pixel-perfect bounding boxes around individual items, so that I can accurately select and catalog each piece without interference from background elements or body parts.

**Detailed Workflow:** When I photograph a wristwatch on my arm, the system should generate a precise bounding box that outlines only the watch face and band, excluding the sleeve, arm, or any background elements. The segmentation should be accurate enough that I can confidently select the watch for cataloging.

### Improved Contextual Filtering

As a reseller documenting inventory, I want the system to intelligently prioritize items of interest over background elements, so that I can focus on cataloging sellable items without manual cleanup of irrelevant detections.

**Detailed Workflow:** When photographing clothing items on a table, the system should detect and highlight only the clothing pieces while intelligently filtering out the table surface, furniture, or any body parts that might be visible in the frame.

### Real-Time Quality Monitoring

As a power user processing multiple photos, I want to see real-time feedback on detection quality, so that I can adjust my photography technique or retake photos when detection accuracy is suboptimal.

**Detailed Workflow:** After analyzing a photo, I should see quality metrics showing precision, recall, and confidence levels, allowing me to make informed decisions about whether to retake the photo or proceed with the current analysis.

## Spec Scope

1. **Enhanced Segmentation Precision** - Improve pixel-level masking accuracy and reduce false positives in edge cases
2. **Advanced Contextual Filtering** - Enhance parent-child relationship detection for better watch/sleeve scenarios
3. **Detection Quality Metrics** - Implement real-time quality monitoring with precision, recall, and confidence tracking
4. **Performance Optimization** - Optimize processing pipeline for better speed and accuracy
5. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment** - Implement real-time confidence threshold optimization based on detection quality

## Out of Scope

- Custom AI model training or fine-tuning
- Integration with additional AI services beyond Google Cloud Vision and Amazon Rekognition
- Real-time video object detection
- Advanced computer vision features like depth estimation or 3D reconstruction
- Batch processing of multiple images simultaneously
- User interface changes beyond quality metrics display

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Enhanced Detection Accuracy**: Achieve >95% precision in item detection with <3% false positive rate for irrelevant objects
2. **Improved Segmentation Quality**: Pixel-perfect bounding boxes with enhanced coordinate precision for better interactive selection
3. **Real-Time Quality Feedback**: Users can see detection quality metrics and make informed decisions about photo retakes
4. **Optimized Performance**: Maintain <3 second processing time while improving accuracy through enhanced algorithms
