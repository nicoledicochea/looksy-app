# Spec Summary (Lite)

Integrate Amazon Rekognition API as a secondary AI analysis service to complement Google Cloud Vision for enhanced item detection and brand recognition. This integration will run alongside Google Vision in parallel, format responses to match existing DetectedItem interface, and implement 1000 image usage limits per user. The feature prepares the foundation for future Multi-API Ensemble System that will combine both services for more accurate results.
