# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Amazon Rekognition Integration
> Created: 2025-09-09

## Overview

Integrate Amazon Rekognition API as a secondary AI analysis service to complement Google Cloud Vision for enhanced item detection and brand recognition. This integration will run alongside Google Vision and prepare the foundation for the Multi-API Ensemble System that will combine both services for more accurate results.

## User Stories

### Enhanced Item Analysis

As a user taking photos of items, I want Amazon Rekognition to analyze my images for better brand detection and fashion recognition, so that I get more accurate item identification and categorization.

When a user captures or uploads a photo, the app will call both Google Cloud Vision and Amazon Rekognition APIs in parallel. Amazon Rekognition will provide additional insights, particularly for clothing items and brand logos, which will be stored alongside Google Vision results for future ensemble processing.

### Cost-Controlled Analysis

As a user, I want to have usage limits on Amazon Rekognition analysis, so that I can control my costs while still benefiting from enhanced AI capabilities.

The app will implement a 1000 image limit per user for Amazon Rekognition calls, with clear feedback when approaching or reaching the limit. Users will still receive Google Vision analysis even when Amazon Rekognition limits are reached.

## Spec Scope

1. **Amazon Rekognition Service Integration** - Create new service to handle Amazon Rekognition API calls with proper authentication and error handling
2. **Parallel API Execution** - Modify existing photo analysis flow to call both Google Vision and Amazon Rekognition simultaneously
3. **Response Formatting** - Format Amazon Rekognition responses to match existing DetectedItem interface for consistency
4. **Usage Tracking** - Implement user-level tracking for Amazon Rekognition API calls with 1000 image limit
5. **Error Handling** - Implement fallback logic where Google Vision continues to work if Amazon Rekognition fails

## Out of Scope

- Multi-API Ensemble System (separate feature)
- Brand Detection System (separate feature)
- AI Summarization System (separate feature)
- Cost management beyond basic usage limits
- Advanced retry logic or circuit breakers

## Expected Deliverable

1. Amazon Rekognition API successfully integrated and returning formatted results matching DetectedItem interface
2. Photo analysis workflow calling both Google Vision and Amazon Rekognition in parallel with proper error handling
3. User usage tracking implemented with 1000 image limit and appropriate user feedback
