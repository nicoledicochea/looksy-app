# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement an interactive item selection system that allows users to click on detected items in both the photo view and item list to create visual connections between AI-detected objects and their locations on the image. This feature transforms the app from a simple list-based interface to an engaging, visual item management system that helps users understand exactly what the AI analyzed and where, enabling individual item actions like edit, delete, and price estimation.
