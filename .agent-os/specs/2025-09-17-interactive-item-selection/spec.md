# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Interactive Item Selection
> Created: 2025-09-17

## Overview

Implement an interactive item selection system that allows users to click on detected items in both the photo view and item list to create visual connections between AI-detected objects and their locations on the image. This feature will transform the app from a simple list-based interface to an engaging, visual item management system that helps users understand exactly what the AI analyzed and where.

## User Stories

### Visual Item Selection

As a user, I want to click on items in the list below my photo, so that I can see exactly where each detected item is located on the image with highlighted bounding boxes.

When I tap an item in the list, the corresponding bounding box on the photo should be highlighted with a colored border, making it clear which object the AI detected and where it's positioned.

### Photo-Based Item Selection

As a user, I want to tap directly on detected items in the photo, so that I can select and interact with individual items without scrolling through the list.

When I tap on a bounding box overlay on the photo, the corresponding item in the list should be selected and highlighted, allowing me to quickly identify and manage specific detected objects.

### Individual Item Management

As a user, I want to perform actions on individual selected items, so that I can edit, delete, or get price estimates for specific objects without affecting other detected items.

When I select an item, I should see action buttons for editing the item details, deleting it from the analysis, or getting a price estimate, giving me granular control over my item catalog.

## Spec Scope

1. **Interactive Photo Viewer** - Display photos with clickable bounding box overlays that respond to user touch events
2. **Bidirectional Selection** - Enable selection synchronization between photo bounding boxes and item list entries
3. **Visual Feedback System** - Provide color-coded bounding boxes, selection highlights, and smooth animations
4. **Individual Item Actions** - Implement edit, delete, and price estimate functionality for selected items
5. **Selection State Management** - Persist selection states and handle multi-item interactions

## Out of Scope

- Multi-selection with drag and drop functionality
- Gesture-based zoom and pan controls
- Voice commands for item selection
- Batch operations on multiple selected items
- Advanced gesture controls (swipe to delete, pinch to zoom)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can tap items in the list to highlight corresponding bounding boxes on the photo with visual feedback
2. Users can tap bounding boxes on the photo to select corresponding items in the list with bidirectional synchronization
3. Users can perform individual actions (edit, delete, price estimate) on selected items with proper UI feedback and state management
