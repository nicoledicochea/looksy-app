# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-17-interactive-item-selection/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **Interactive Photo Viewer Component**: Create a React Native component that displays photos with overlay bounding boxes that respond to touch events
- **Bounding Box Overlay System**: Implement color-coded rectangular overlays positioned using normalized coordinates (0-1 range) for responsive display across device sizes
- **Touch Event Handling**: Capture touch events on bounding boxes and convert screen coordinates to normalized coordinates for item identification
- **Selection State Management**: Implement bidirectional selection synchronization between photo overlays and item list using React Context
- **Visual Feedback System**: Provide smooth animations, color-coded bounding boxes by category, and selection highlight indicators
- **Individual Item Actions**: Create action buttons for edit, delete, and price estimate functionality with proper confirmation dialogs
- **Data Structure Updates**: Enhance DetectedItem interface with bounding box coordinates and selection state properties
- **API Integration Updates**: Modify Google Cloud Vision and Amazon Rekognition services to extract and return bounding box coordinate data
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure smooth animations at 60fps and touch response times under 100ms
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Implement proper touch targets (minimum 44px Ã— 44px) and screen reader support

## External Dependencies

- **react-native-svg** - For rendering precise bounding box overlays and smooth animations
  - **Justification:** React Native's built-in View components don't provide the precision needed for accurate bounding box positioning and smooth animations required for professional visual feedback
