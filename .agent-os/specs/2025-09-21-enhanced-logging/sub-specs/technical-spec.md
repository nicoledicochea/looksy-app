# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-21-enhanced-logging/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **Logging Service Architecture**: Create a centralized logging service that can be injected into existing analysis pipeline components
- **Raw API Response Capture**: Intercept and log complete Google Vision API responses including all detected objects, confidence scores, bounding boxes, and segmentation masks
- **Raw API Response Capture**: Intercept and log complete Amazon Rekognition API responses including detected items, confidence scores, and color information
- **Color Detection Comparison**: Extract and log color data from both APIs for side-by-side comparison and debugging
- **Overlap Analysis Engine**: Implement geometric overlap calculation between bounding boxes to determine intersection areas and overlap percentages
- **Visibility Calculation System**: Calculate item visibility percentage based on bounding box area minus overlapped areas
- **Configurable Log Levels**: Implement logging configuration system with DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR levels
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure logging doesn't impact analysis performance by using asynchronous logging and configurable verbosity
- **Log Format Standardization**: Implement consistent JSON log format for all logging outputs with timestamps and context information
- **Integration Points**: Integrate logging into existing enhanced detection pipeline, AI analysis service, and storage service
- **External Logging Transport**: Implement configurable external logging transport layer supporting HTTP, WebSocket, and file-based exports
- **External Service Integration**: Support integration with Splunk (HTTP Event Collector), Datadog (Logs API), and LogRocket (Custom Events)
- **Cursor Integration API**: Create API endpoints or file-based interface for Cursor to access and analyze log data
- **Log Buffering System**: Implement local log buffering with retry logic for offline scenarios and network failures

## External Dependencies

- **react-native-logs** - Professional logging library for React Native with external service support
- **Justification**: Provides structured logging, external transport capabilities, and performance optimization for React Native
- **Version**: Latest stable version (^2.0.0)

- **@react-native-async-storage/async-storage** - Already included in tech stack for log buffering
- **Justification**: Use existing AsyncStorage for local log buffering and offline scenarios

- **Optional External Service SDKs** (choose one based on preference):
  - **Splunk**: @splunk/otel-js-web or custom HTTP Event Collector implementation
  - **Datadog**: @datadog/browser-rum or @datadog/browser-logs
  - **LogRocket**: logrocket-react-native
- **Justification**: Professional external logging services for centralized log management and real-time analysis
