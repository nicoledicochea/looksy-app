# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Enhanced Logging System
> Created: 2025-09-21

## Overview

Implement comprehensive logging system for AI analysis pipeline to capture raw API responses, color detection data, overlap analysis, and visibility calculations. This enhanced logging will provide debugging insights to understand current data flow and identify root causes of color detection issues and multiple item analysis problems.

## User Stories

### Developer Debugging Story

As a developer, I want to see complete raw API responses from Google Vision and Amazon Rekognition, so that I can understand why items are being filtered out and debug color detection inconsistencies.

The developer will be able to view detailed logs showing exactly what each API detects, including confidence scores, bounding boxes, color data, and segmentation masks. This will help identify discrepancies between APIs and understand filtering decisions.

### Analysis Quality Story

As a developer, I want to track overlap analysis and visibility calculations, so that I can optimize the enhanced detection pipeline and improve item isolation accuracy.

The system will log detailed overlap analysis showing which items overlap, by what percentage, and why certain items are filtered out. Visibility calculations will show how much of each item is actually visible versus occluded.

### Performance Monitoring Story

As a developer, I want configurable logging levels, so that I can enable detailed debugging in development while maintaining performance in production.

The logging system will support different verbosity levels, allowing developers to enable comprehensive logging during development and debugging while keeping production logs minimal for performance.

## Spec Scope

1. **Raw API Data Logging** - Capture complete Google Vision and Amazon Rekognition responses with all detected items, confidence scores, and metadata
2. **Color Detection Logging** - Log color data from both APIs for comparison and debugging color detection inconsistencies
3. **Overlap Analysis Logging** - Track item overlaps, overlap percentages, and filtering decisions with detailed reasoning
4. **Visibility Calculation Logging** - Calculate and log item visibility percentages based on bounding box overlap analysis
5. **Configurable Log Levels** - Implement logging configuration system to control verbosity in development vs production
6. **External Logging Integration** - Support for external logging services (Splunk, Datadog, LogRocket) for centralized log management and real-time analysis
7. **Cursor Integration** - Enable log data access within Cursor chat for streamlined debugging and analysis

## Out of Scope

- Log compression or archival (keep logs simple and readable)
- Advanced log analytics dashboards (focus on basic external logging)
- Log retention policies (handled by external service)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Enhanced logging system that captures raw Google Vision and Amazon Rekognition API responses with complete item detection data
2. Comprehensive overlap analysis logging showing item relationships, overlap percentages, and filtering decisions
3. Configurable logging system with development and production modes for optimal performance
4. Visibility calculation system that accurately determines how much of each detected item is actually visible
5. External logging integration supporting Splunk, Datadog, or LogRocket for centralized log management
6. Cursor integration capability enabling log data access within development chat for streamlined debugging
