> Spec: Enhanced Object Detection Pipeline
> Created: 2025-01-18

## Overview

Implement an enhanced object detection pipeline that combines instance segmentation with intelligent filtering to accurately identify and isolate individual items while eliminating irrelevant objects like body parts, sleeves, and background elements. This improvement will significantly enhance the accuracy of the Interactive Item Selection feature by providing clean, precise bounding boxes for only the items users want to catalog.

## User Stories

### Accurate Item Detection

As a user cataloging items, I want the AI to detect only the actual items I'm trying to catalog (like watches, jewelry, clothing), so that I don't have to manually filter out irrelevant detections like my hands, arms, or sleeves.

**Detailed Workflow:** When I take a photo of a wristwatch on my arm, the system should detect and highlight only the watch itself, not the sleeve or arm. The bounding box should precisely outline just the watch, making it easy for me to select and catalog the specific item I'm interested in.

### Intelligent Background Filtering

As a reseller documenting inventory, I want the system to automatically ignore background elements and furniture, so that I can focus on cataloging only the items I'm selling without manual cleanup.

**Detailed Workflow:** When I photograph items on a table or desk, the system should detect and highlight only the sellable items (clothing, electronics, accessories) while ignoring the table, desk, or other furniture in the background.

### Precise Multi-Item Isolation

As an estate planner cataloging collections, I want each individual item to be detected and isolated separately, so that I can catalog each piece individually even when items are overlapping or clustered together.

**Detailed Workflow:** When photographing a jewelry collection spread on a surface, each ring, necklace, and bracelet should be detected as separate items with precise bounding boxes, even if they're touching or overlapping.

## Spec Scope

1. **Instance Segmentation Integration** - Implement pixel-level object isolation using Google Cloud Vision's OBJECT_LOCALIZATION feature with segmentation masks
2. **Intelligent Category Filtering** - Add category-based filtering to automatically exclude body parts, furniture, and background elements
3. **Parent-Child Relationship Detection** - Implement logic to prioritize child objects (like watches) over parent objects (like sleeves)
4. **Size-Based Overlap Resolution** - Add algorithms to handle overlapping bounding boxes and resolve conflicts intelligently
5. **Enhanced Bounding Box Precision** - Improve coordinate accuracy and reduce false positives through multi-stage filtering

## Out of Scope

- Real-time video object detection
- Custom AI model training
- Integration with additional AI services beyond Google Cloud Vision and Amazon Rekognition
- Advanced computer vision features like depth estimation or 3D reconstruction
- Batch processing of multiple images simultaneously

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Enhanced Detection Accuracy**: Achieve >90% precision in item detection with <5% false positive rate for irrelevant objects
2. **Improved Interactive Selection**: Users can successfully select individual items without interference from body parts or background elements
3. **Seamless Integration**: Enhanced detection pipeline integrates smoothly with existing InteractivePhotoViewer component and maintains current performance standards
