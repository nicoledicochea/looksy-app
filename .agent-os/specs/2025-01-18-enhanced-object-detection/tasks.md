  - [x] 1.2 Enhance realAiService.ts to include OBJECT_LOCALIZATION feature with segmentation masks
  - [x] 1.3 Update DetectedItem interface to support segmentation mask data and enhanced bounding box precision
  - [x] 1.4 Implement pixel-level coordinate conversion from segmentation masks to bounding boxes
  - [x] 1.5 Add fallback mechanism to current detection system if enhanced features fail
