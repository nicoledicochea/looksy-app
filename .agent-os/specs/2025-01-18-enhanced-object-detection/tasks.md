  - [ ] 1.1 Write tests for enhanced Google Cloud Vision API integration with OBJECT_LOCALIZATION
  - [ ] 1.2 Enhance realAiService.ts to include OBJECT_LOCALIZATION feature with segmentation masks
  - [ ] 1.3 Update DetectedItem interface to support segmentation mask data and enhanced bounding box precision
  - [ ] 1.4 Implement pixel-level coordinate conversion from segmentation masks to bounding boxes
  - [ ] 1.5 Add fallback mechanism to current detection system if enhanced features fail
  - [ ] 1.6 Verify all tests pass

- [ ] 2. **Create Intelligent Category Filtering System**
  - [ ] 2.1 Write tests for category-based filtering logic and object classification
  - [ ] 2.2 Create comprehensive category mapping with "objects of interest" vs "objects to ignore" lists
  - [ ] 2.3 Implement category-based filtering pipeline to automatically exclude body parts, furniture, and background elements
  - [ ] 2.4 Add confidence threshold adjustments based on object category (higher thresholds for ignored categories)

  - [ ] 3.5 Verify all tests pass

- [ ] 4. **Build Size-Based Overlap Resolution System**
  - [ ] 4.1 Write tests for overlap detection algorithms and conflict resolution logic
  - [ ] 4.2 Implement algorithms to calculate bounding box overlap percentages
  - [ ] 4.3 Create conflict resolution logic to prioritize smaller, more specific detections over larger ones
  - [ ] 4.4 Add geometric analysis for handling overlapping bounding boxes intelligently
  - [ ] 4.5 Verify all tests pass

- [ ] 5. **Integrate Enhanced Detection Pipeline**
  - [ ] 5.1 Write tests for complete enhanced detection pipeline integration
