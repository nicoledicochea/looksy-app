# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-01-18-enhanced-object-detection/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **Instance Segmentation Integration**: Enhance Google Cloud Vision API calls to include OBJECT_LOCALIZATION feature with segmentation masks for pixel-level object isolation
- **Multi-Stage Filtering Pipeline**: Implement sequential filtering stages (category → parent-child → size-based) to progressively refine detection results
- **Category-Based Filtering System**: Create comprehensive category mapping with "objects of interest" vs "objects to ignore" lists for automatic filtering
- **Parent-Child Relationship Detection**: Implement spatial analysis algorithms to detect when smaller objects of interest are contained within larger objects to ignore
- **Size-Based Overlap Resolution**: Add algorithms to calculate bounding box overlap percentages and resolve conflicts by prioritizing smaller, more specific detections
- **Enhanced Coordinate Precision**: Improve bounding box coordinate accuracy through segmentation mask analysis and edge detection
- **Performance Optimization**: Maintain <3 second processing time per image while improving accuracy through efficient filtering algorithms
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Ensure graceful degradation to current detection system if enhanced features fail or are unavailable

## External Dependencies

- **Google Cloud Vision API Enhancement**: Upgrade to use OBJECT_LOCALIZATION feature with segmentation masks
  - **Justification:** Required for pixel-level object isolation and precise bounding box generation
  - **Version:** Latest Google Cloud Vision API v1
- **React Native SVG**: Already installed for precise bounding box rendering
  - **Justification:** Needed for accurate overlay positioning based on enhanced coordinate data
- **Math.js**: For advanced geometric calculations in overlap detection and spatial analysis
  - **Justification:** Required for complex bounding box intersection calculations and parent-child relationship detection
