# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement an enhanced object detection pipeline that combines instance segmentation with intelligent filtering to accurately identify and isolate individual items while eliminating irrelevant objects like body parts, sleeves, and background elements. This improvement will significantly enhance the accuracy of the Interactive Item Selection feature by providing clean, precise bounding boxes for only the items users want to catalog, achieving >90% precision with <5% false positive rate.
