# Plan Product Rules

## Overview
Generate product documentation for a new project based on a user's idea, using structured templates and a user-approval process.

## Process Flow

### Step 1: Gather User Input

**Step 1: Gather User Input**
Collect essential project details from the user.

**Data Sources:**
- Primary: user_direct_input

**Required Fields:**
- Main idea
- Key features
- Target users
- Tech stack preferences

**Instructions:**
- ACTION: Ask the user for project details.
- VALIDATE: Ensure all required fields are provided.

### Step 2: Create Product Documentation

**Step 2: Create Product Documentation**
Create the project's foundational documents using structured templates.

**File Templates:**

**mission.md:**
- Mission Statement
- User Stories
- Pitches (Short and Long)

**roadmap.md:**
- Phase 1: MVP
- Phase 2: Core Features
- Phase 3: Scale

**Instructions:**
- ACTION: Create files docs/mission.md and docs/roadmap.md. Create the docs folder if it doesn't exist.
- POPULATE: The files with information gathered from the user.

### Step 3: User Approval

**Step 3: User Approval**
Request user review and approval of the generated plan.

**Review Request:**
```
I've created the product documentation based on your idea. Please review the following files:

docs/mission.md
docs/roadmap.md
```

**Instructions:**
- ACTION: Present the files and wait for user's explicit approval.
- LOOP: IF user requests changes, repeat steps 1-3.
- COMPLETE: Rule is complete only upon explicit user approval.
