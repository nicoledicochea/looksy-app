# Execute Tasks Rules

## Overview
Execute a specific task from the tasks.md checklist by following a systematic, three-phase TDD workflow.

## Process Flow

### Phase 1: Pre-Execution Setup

#### Step 1: Task Assignment

**Step 1: Task Assignment**
Identify the task to be executed and gather necessary context.

**Instructions:**
- ACTION: Identify task to execute, either explicitly specified by the user or the next uncompleted task.
- GATHER: Read all relevant context from docs folder files (docs/mission.md, docs/roadmap.md, docs/tasks.md).

### Phase 2: Execution Loop

#### Step 2: Task Execution

**Step 2: Task Execution**
Execute each sub-task in a strict, sequential loop.

**Instructions:**
- ACTION: Process each sub-task one by one.
- CRITICAL: The agent MUST write the test code and confirm it fails before any implementation.
- IMPLEMENT: Write only the necessary code to make the test pass.
- REFINE: Refactor code to improve its quality while ensuring all tests stay green.
- UPDATE: Mark the current sub-task as complete in tasks.md upon success.
- REPEAT: Continue this loop until all sub-tasks for the current task are complete.

### Phase 3: Post-Execution Tasks

#### Step 3: Finalize and Report

**Step 3: Finalize and Report**
Execute all post-completion steps to finalize the task.

**Instructions:**
- CRITICAL: This phase MUST be executed after the Execution Loop is complete.
- RUN: The full project test suite.
- UPDATE: The docs/roadmap.md file to reflect the completed feature.
- MARK: The parent task as complete in docs/tasks.md.
- GENERATE: A final recap document summarizing the work.
