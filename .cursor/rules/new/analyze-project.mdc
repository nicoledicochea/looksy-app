# Analyze Current Product & Install Cursor

## Overview
Analyze an existing codebase to generate a structured analysis.md file that provides a foundational understanding for the AI agent.

## Process Flow

### Step 1: Analyze Codebase

**Step 1: Analyze Codebase**
Thoroughly analyze the existing codebase to understand its current state.

**Analysis Areas:**
- **Project Structure**
  - Directory organization
  - File naming patterns
  - Module structure
  - Build configuration
- **Technology Stack**
  - Frameworks in use
  - Dependencies (e.g., package.json, requirements.txt)
  - Database systems
  - Infrastructure configuration
- **Implementation Progress**
  - Completed features
  - Work in progress
  - API endpoints
  - Database schema
- **Code Patterns**
  - Coding style in use
  - Naming conventions
  - Testing approach

**Instructions:**
- ACTION: Analyze the codebase and document findings.
- OUTPUT: A summary of the codebase's technology, structure, and progress.

### Step 2: Create Analysis File

**Step 2: Create Analysis File**
Create the analysis.md with a structured template.

**File Template:**
```markdown
# Project Analysis

## Project Overview
## Tech Stack
## Project Structure
## Implementation Status
## Code Style
```

**Instructions:**
- ACTION: Create file docs/analysis.md. Create the docs folder if it doesn't exist.
- POPULATE: The file with structured information from the analysis.

### Step 3: User Confirmation

**Step 3: User Confirmation**
Present the generated documentation to the user and confirm completion.

**Summary Template:**
```
âœ… Analysis Complete
I've analyzed your codebase and created documentation that reflects your current implementation.

Next Steps:
- Review the generated documentation in docs/analysis.md
- Use the rules for plan-product or create-tasks to begin development.
```

**Instructions:**
- ACTION: Await user confirmation before proceeding with other tasks.
