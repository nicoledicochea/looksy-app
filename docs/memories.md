# Looksy App Development - Progress & Next Steps

## 🎉 What We've Accomplished So Far

### Project Setup ✅
- **Created Looksy React Native project** using Expo with TypeScript template
- **Set up proper folder structure** according to technical specification:
  ```
  looksy-app/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── components/
  │   │   ├── Camera/          # Camera-related components
  │   │   ├── ItemCard/        # Item display components  
  │   │   ├── Forms/           # Input forms and validation
  │   │   └── Common/          # Shared UI elements
  │   ├── screens/             # App screens/pages
  │   ├── services/            # External API integrations
  │   ├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
  │   ├── utils/               # Helper functions
  │   ├── types/               # TypeScript type definitions
  │   └── store/               # State management
  ├── assets/                  # Images and resources
  ├── docs/                    # Documentation
  └── App.tsx                 # Main app component
  ```

- **Expo setup guide** created for reference

## 🚀 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Foundation & Testing (This Week)
1. **Test the app** - Install Expo Go and scan QR code to see basic app
2. **Initialize git repository** - Set up version control
3. **Create basic navigation** - Set up React Navigation between screens
4. **Build camera screen** - Core functionality for taking photos
5. **Add basic item display** - Show detected items in a list

### Phase 2: Core Features (Next 2-3 Weeks)
1. **Camera integration** - Native camera access and photo capture
2. **Image processing** - Connect to Google Cloud Vision API
3. **Item detection** - AI-powered object identification
4. **Item management** - Add, edit, delete items in catalog
5. **Basic UI/UX** - Clean, intuitive interface

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Following Weeks)
1. **Price estimation** - Reverse image search and price data
2. **Batch processing** - Handle multiple items at once
3. **Report generation** - Export catalogs for tax/donation purposes
4. **Cloud sync** - Backup and sync across devices
5. **Performance optimization** - Speed and reliability improvements

### Phase 4: Polish & Launch (Final Phase)
1. **UI/UX refinement** - Professional design and animations
2. **Testing & bug fixes** - Comprehensive testing on real devices
3. **App store preparation** - Screenshots, descriptions, metadata
4. **Launch strategy** - Beta testing and user feedback

## 🎯 Current Focus
**Completed Phase 1! Ready to move to Phase 2: Core Features**

## ✅ Phase 1 Completed Features
- **Bottom navigation** - 5 tabs: Home, Camera, Gallery, Catalog, Settings
